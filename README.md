### Description

Crypting program created for encrypt/decrypt files.

It is very fast, and best for images (JPEG, BMP, GIF...), but you can use it for crypt-decrypt video or other files... No special encription metod was used, (just reversing some bynary data), so it is not good for textual files, use it only for binary files! - e. g. if you want to protect your images from viewing by other people :-)

To encrypt/decrypt files, you have to choose one or more files, or folder where files you want to process exists.

Only selected files (when check-box is selected) will be processed. When you choose some files or folders, all files in list-box are selected automaticaly. If you want to exclude a file from encrypt/decrypt process, uncheck it.

By clicking on Start button, process starts.

If a file is previously encrypted with this tool, it will be decrypted.

A file that is not previously encrypted with this tool, will be encrypted.
